  I work on ML/AI systems under real constraints. Limited compute, 
  imperfect data, adversarial settings, and deployment requirements. 
  Most of my projects focus on stress-testing and understanding where 
  they actually break in practice. My background spans deep learning, 
  computer vision, and mission-facing software.
