  I work on ML and AI systems under real constraints—limited compute, 
  non-IID data, adversarial settings, and deployment requirements. 
  Most of my projects focus on stress-testing and understanding where 
  they actually break in practice. My background spans deep learning, 
  computer vision, and mission-facing software.
