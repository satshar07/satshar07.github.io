# Satyam
**Cal CS + ORMS + Math grad**

Hey 👋! I'm Satyam, a recent Berkeley grad whose focus these past few years has been both research and taking ideas out of papers and into real systems.

Areas I've been reading into/exploring recently revolve around performance engineering, inference-time optimizations, agents, and robotics.

## Research

### EnsembleGold — Monocular Depth Estimation
Worked on novel diffusion-based depth estimation using novel inference-time techniques only. Achieved a significant (~10-20%) improvement on various error metrics on zero-shot monocular depth estimation without retraining. Thank you to Prof. Jitendra Malik and Prof. Anjoo Kanazawa.

***

### Dynamic Hyperparameter Optimization
Evaluated population-based training and hypergradient-style updates for vision transformers. Showed that the overhead and instability of "moving" hyperparameters are often more costly than the benefits of a dynamic schedule.

***

## Technical Skills
Python; PyTorch; NumPy; C++; C; distributed training and inference; vision transformers; diffusion models; ensemble and test-time inference methods; latent-variable and state-space modeling; graph-based dependency analysis (SBOMs); agent-based automated reasoning systems

## Commercial

### Second Front Systems
Built an agentic reasoning system for vulnerability remediation in defense software, reasoning over SBOMs and dependency graphs to propose fixes. Work highlighted at a Second Front investor meeting.

***

### Falkonry
Modeled adversarial EW signals under intentional distribution shift. Focused on latent state inference under non-stationary dynamics. Separated structured behavior from deception.

## Other experiences
Am grateful to have spent time as the first growth hire at a Founders Fund-backed startup, a summer at the State Department, doing AI research at Berkeley, leading my student consulting club on campus into a $1mm+ ARR business, and being the sole organizer/facilitator of the National Security Entrepreneurship Club at Berkeley (worked with 4 corporate sponsors; advised by the Pentagon, the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, and some folks leading Stanford's DefTech MBA club).
