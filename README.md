# Satyam Sharma
**Computer Science + Operations Research + Math @ Cal ('25)**

I work on ML/AI systems under real constraints like limited compute, imperfect data, and in stringent production environments. My focus has been on taking state-of-the-art ideas out of papers and into real systems, and understanding why they often fail in practice. 

Areas I've been reading into/exploring recently revolve around performance engineering, inference-time optimizations, agents, and robotics.

## Research

### Dynamic Hyperparameter Optimization
<p class="tldr">TLDR: Showed why online hyperparameter methods often underperform static baselines.</p>
Evaluating Population-Based Training and hypergradient-style updates for Vision Transformers. Found many adaptive methods converge to conservative regimes due to short-horizon optimization. Pending publication.

### EnsembleGold — Monocular Depth
<p class="tldr">TLDR: Improved diffusion-based depth estimation using inference-time techniques only.</p>
Achieved a significant (~10-20%) improvement on various error metrics on zero-shot monocular depth estimation without retraining. Thank you to Prof. Jitendra Malik and Prof. Anjoo Kanazawa.

## Commercial / Mission-Facing

### Second Front Systems
<p class="tldr">TLDR: Agentic system for vulnerability remediation in defense software.</p>
Built an engine reasoning over SBOMs and dependency graphs to propose fixes. Work highlighted at a Second Front investor meeting.

### Falkonry
<p class="tldr">TLDR: Modeled adversarial EW signals under intentional distribution shift.</p>
Focused on latent state inference under non-stationary dynamics. Separated structured behavior from deception.
